            <p>
                Hello! I'm Brian Njoroge, a passionate software developer with expertise in building exceptional digital experiences. 
                I focus on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy the challenge of learning 
                new technologies and applying them to create innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                What drives me is the blend of technical problem-solving and creative thinking that software development requires. 
                I believe in writing code that's not just functional but also maintainable and scalable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
                and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
            </p>
